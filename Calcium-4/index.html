			<h1>The Future of the healthcare: 3D Bioprinting of Tissues</h1>
			<p>Currently, hundreds of thousands of people are waiting for an organ transplant., but unfortunately, the world does not have enough donors to accommodate all the patients. And this is where the bioprinting of human tissue comes in. 3D bioprinting is an emerging branch of regenerative medicine, it is similar to 3D printing. However, bioprinting uses bio-ink, a printable material that contains living cells. Materials or cells may be obtained from donors or, much better, from patients to lessen the chances of the body rejecting the printed tissue. Although printing thin tissues, like skin and meniscus, is the only successful project in the present, researchers are looking forward to the future of this technology.</p>

			<h1>The Science Concepts involved in 3d Bioprinting</h1>
				<h2>Chemistry</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>The use of bio-ink, which is made up of either natural or synthetic biomaterials;</li>
						<li>Biomaterials are a key component of printing tissue. Polymers are a readily available and easy to mold material used to make tissue. Metals and metal alloys such as gold, platinum, titanium, and more are used to make orthopedic implants. Ceramics and carbon compounds are used to make bioactive orthopedic implants, while calcium phosphate salts (HA), glass, and oxides of aluminum and titanium are used to make dental implants and artificial hearing aids. These are examples of biomaterials and what they are used for in 3D Printing as there are many more biomaterials for different purposes.</li>
					</ol>
				<h2>Biology</h2>
					<p>Tissue printing through the use of biomaterials is currently used for drug testing and the development of non-transferable tissues and vessels. As this technology advances, we will be able to offer a low-cost alternative to organ transplantation.</p>
				<h2>Physics</h2>
					<p>3D bioprinting is mainly used for its mechanical properties. An example is the duration of the creation of the tissue. Some researchers have been experimenting with different mechanical devices that can improve the speed of bioprinting. The model predicted that the bio-inks would merge more quickly in the presence of an external force, and the researchers used this prediction to create their approach. They were able to expedite bio-ink fusion using the model while minimizing damage to preexisting cells by adjusting the force's magnitude. The grooves' geometry produced a rotational torque and other mechanical forces that caused the bioink segments to press against each other, and by imaging the structural evolution of the fusing bioinks, they found that fusion occurred 3 times faster in the grooves than it did on a flat platform. The forces acting on the bioinks can be precisely adjusted in the bioprinter that the researchers are currently creating (Chen, 2021).</p>
