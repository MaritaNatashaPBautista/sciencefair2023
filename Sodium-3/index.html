                <p>Have you ever had an experience when you were having a really bad day and when you listened to music, it improved your mood? Have you ever wondered if there was an actual scientific explanation on why this happens? Can this help our moods or feelings? This project aims to answer these questions and find out if this can be a revolutionary discovery for future methods of therapy.</p>
                <p>Music therapists use a person's responses and connections to music to encourage positive changes in mood and general mental mindset. Music therapy can include listening to music or creating music with instruments of all types. It may also involve singing or moving to music. It is an alternative to other types of therapy, such as counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Zoppi, 2020).</p>

                <p>A lot of synthetic drugs used in the treatment of mental health illnesses have side-effects, which led researchers to look for alternative therapies with no side effects. Research on music therapy suggests that it can produce positive results on the mental wellbeing of patients.</p>

                    <p>As shown in Figure 1, dopamine (C8H11NO2) is made through a process of biosynthesization (a complex production of chemical compounds made by living organisms) in the body, mainly by nervous tissue and the medulla of the adrenal glands. First going through an oxidation reaction (hydroxylation) of the amino acid L-tyrosine to L-DOPA via the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, also known as tyrosine hydroxylase, and then by the decarboxylation of L-DOPA by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (World Of Chemicals, n.d.). The enzyme dopamine Î²-hydroxylase absorbs dopamine into vesicles and converts it to norepinephrine. The enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase converts norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla and a few specific areas of the brain (Aminoff & Daroff, 2003).</p>

                <p>Sound is a form of energy that is produced by the vibration of an object. These vibrations create pressure waves, which propagate through a medium such as air or water. The study of these pressure waves is known as the physics of sound. Sound waves are classified as longitudinal waves, which means that they travel in the same direction as the wave is moving.</p>

                <p>Music therapy is a highly personalized type of therapy. There is a great deal of customization and specification involved. In its formal forms of therapy, it requires getting in touch with a licensed therapist who can choose the course of treatment that is best for a person. In contrast, informal types of therapy can involve casually enjoying music, singing along, playing instruments, and dancing. Music therapy is a generally established idea in research due to its versatility and efficacy, and some of its advantages and applications are listed below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It eases pain. In individuals with chronic pain disorders, music therapy has been shown to lessen pain intensity and enhance pain management (Lai et al., 2021).</li>
                    <li>It reduces depression and anxiety. Numerous individuals, including cancer patients, people with chronic pain, and people who have mental health disorders including depression and anxiety, have found this type of therapy to be successful in lowering the symptoms (Yang et al., 2021).</li>
                    <li>It boosts motor function. The balance and walking of people with Parkinson's disease and other mobility abnormalities have been proven to be improved by it (Brockett et al., 2021).</li>
                    <li>It enhances cognitive abilities. According to research, music therapy helps people with dementia perform more cognitively, those with Alzheimer's disease experience fewer behavioral symptoms, and people with other neurological illnesses benefit from it as well (Zeng et al., 2020).</li>
                    <li>It improves social abilities. It has been demonstrated that the therapy helps children that have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental difficulties to strengthen their social skills (Brownell et al., 2020).</li>
                    <li>In relation to the concepts above, music therapy also helps alleviate stress, lessen blood pressure, and enhance memory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To conclude, music is an everyday concept that has a significant presence in every person's life. It is widely utilized and can be used clinically to treat patients through music therapy. Music therapy has a variety of advantages that are connected to the biology, chemistry, and physics that underlie it, making it a highly valuable scientific advancement.</p>
