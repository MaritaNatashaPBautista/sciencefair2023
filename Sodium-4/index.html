			<h2>Biology</h2>
				<p>This study centers on biomimicry – the science of mimicking and applying structures and mechanisms from organisms in nature to create efficient man-made designs. The netting patterns of spiderwebs, for example, have been copied onto glass windows to deter birds from colliding. The chemical composition of leaves has also influenced the development of long-lasting foams and plastics. Even the dynamics of an Australian forest have been used to establish sustainable factories (Biomimicry 2.8, n.d.). The overall anatomy and structure of fly wings were studied and deemed fit to be mimicked onto ornithopter wings.</p>
				<p>The features of fly wings, which were applied in the DelFly Nimble, have evolved over time to maximize aerodynamic efficiency: flexibility, shape, frequency, and stroke (Krishna et al., 2020).</p>
				<p>Fly wings are mostly made of chitin, a polysaccharide that is thin and elastic but durable (this will be further discussed in the Chemistry section) (Hou et al., 2021). However, these wings also require some structure and rigidity. Veins and sensory receptors such as campaniform sensilla, inverted bristles, and afferent nerves provide structural support while keeping weight to a minimum. Also, wing membranes are active aerodynamic surfaces composed of multiple layers of cuticle of varying thickness that form fine geometrical structures known as wing corrugation. This wing corrugation increases stiffness, preventing wing deformation during flight. The scale of these structures is much smaller than that of wing primary flow structures, such as wing tips and leading edge vortices, so that flight is not interfered with. Fly wings are finely tuned structures that allow them to fly with strength and endurance in general (Krishna et al., 2020).</p>
				<p>Moreover, fly wings have a tapered shape, similar to Figure 3; the wing is thinner at its end. This allows the balancing of the four flight forces to be discussed in the Physics section. Because of this shape and the semi-flexible structure of fly wings, flies are able to flap their wings at high frequencies and maintain a rotating stroke of flapping, helping them fly fast, turn sharply, and hover in a stable manner (Krishna et al., 2020). In a broad sense, being able to fly efficiently is crucial to the flies’ survival. They are able to evade predators, reproduce in hard-to-find crevices, and latch onto food.</p>
