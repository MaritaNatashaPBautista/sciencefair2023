            Hi, there! It is really nice to meet you &#9829 We hope that you are enjoying elementary. We are one of the many websites you will be looking through today. You have looked through many websites and probably been amazed by most of them, and now you are looking through ours. Now, what makes us different? Let me tell you. As you can see from our animation, we are gonna be talking about plants and in particular, their survival. We want to talk to you about "Engineering climate SMART crops"., and as you scroll through this website, you are gonna learn about the basics of photosynthesis, some facts about a climate change, the latest news on engineering climate smart crops, and an extra surprise at the end so stay tuned.... In the end, we truly hope that you have fun looking at this website (You will go through the same hardwork when you go to our school). <br><br> HAVE FUN From your ates and kuyas in Grade 9 Sodium-Group2
