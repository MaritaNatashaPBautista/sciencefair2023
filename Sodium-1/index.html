        <p> 
            In 1927, Hermann J. Muller, an American geneticist, had discovered the effect of X-ray to gene structures by causing it to produce
		mutations and undergo chromosome changes. Another geneticist named Lewis Stadler published his research about the mutations of crop plants,
		such as barley and maize, after being exposed to radiation. Their researches have paved the way in our current breeding procedures used in 
		agriculture and possibly, future methods of mutation breeding.
        </p>
            <p>
            Mutation breeding is the use of a plant’s own genetic make-up to mimic the natural process of spontaneous mutation. It is used to accelerate 
		the process of developing and selecting new valuable agronomic traits and through this, mutant plants are made with new and useful traits. Currently,
		mutation breeding either uses radiation such as those from Gamma rays and X-rays, or through a newer method called “particle breeding” which uses 
		charged particles that may be in the form of a heavy ion or proton.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although mutation breeding and traditional crop breeding share the same goal of creating better and desirable traits in plants,
		they differ in the way that they are produced. Traditional methods rely on the traits of two plants and combine them either through breeding them
		naturally, adding a specific strip of DNA into the plant’s genome, or backcrossing. Meanwhile, mutation breeding directly or indirectly alters a 
		plant’s genetic makeup without introducing new genetic material. In addition, mutation breeding creates mutations that may be unstable thus limiting
		the process of generating the preferable alleles. However, mutation breeding can be used as a way to identify what would be the best trait to amplify
		in a plant and using other methods such as introgression breeding to be able to recreate that amplified trait.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to the tendency of random mutations, mutation breeding is found to be essential in creating diverse traits in plants. It is also a key 
		tool used for identifying regulatory genes and molecular mechanisms, and studying the evolution of animals’ relationships and genetic makeup. 
		These show that mutation breeding is an important factor in modern technology as a means of efficient food production and source of varying traits.
